# Suppress known data race in Catch2 test tracker constructing section names
# The report manifests as a write in std::basic_string::_M_set_length while
# another thread reads atomics during scheduler startup, but it occurs inside
# Catch2's tracking during test startup/tear-down and is unrelated to libcoro primitives.
#
# Stack example:
#   std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>::_M_set_length
#   Catch::TestCaseTracking::NameAndLocation::NameAndLocation
#   Catch::TestCaseTracking::ITracker::ITracker
